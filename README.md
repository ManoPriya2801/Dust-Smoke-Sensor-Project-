# Dust-Smoke-Sensor-Project-
This is the code for the project "Smart Stabilizer for air conditioners". It uses sensors to detect voltage fluctuations, dust density, and smoke presence, alerting the user via LEDs, an LCD display, and a buzzer. The system helps prevent overcurrent, overheating, and air quality issues, ensuring the AC operates efficiently and safely.
